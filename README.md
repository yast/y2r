Y2R
===

Y2R is a transpiler translating YCP code into Ruby.

[YCP](http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/YaST/SLES10/tdg/Book-YCPLanguage.html) is
a legacy language that is used internally in SUSE to write parts of
[YaST](http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST). This tool will help to get rid of
it.

**This is currently work in progress and it's probably not useful yet.**
